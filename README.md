# webDev
second semaster styling assignment

This is a very simple static webpage for the class of web design, the goal is to redesign an already existing site called tartare.gr.
Dynamic/web app version of this site will be available on another repo. 

---DESIGN FLAWS---
The assignment requires us to use images from the original already existing site tartare.gr, this site for some reason is using .jpg and .png images instead 
of the much prefered format of .svg, this slows the whole site but it remains a requirment. 

There is a known issue completely described at the issues section, it will be fixed if the site does not undergoe redesign.
